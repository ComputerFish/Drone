For years, I’ve been fascinated by the drone scene. Watching drones capture cinematic shots or race through obstacles sparked my interest, and I wanted to give it a try. Having never built or even owned a drone before, I had a lot to learn. I began by brainstorming what I wanted from a drone since not all drones are built for the same purpose. I prioritized speed and maneuverability first, with range and flight time as secondary considerations. Once I had a clear vision, it was time to start purchasing parts and equipment.


# Parts & Components

Before touching a soldering iron, I gathered the core parts for the build.
Key Components:

**RadioMaster TX16S** - multi-protocol transmitter with hall-effect gimbals for precise stick feel.  
**DJI Goggles N3** - low-latency digital FPV system.  
**T-Motor F7 HD** - flight controller designed for clean integration with HD video systems.  
**T-Motor 55A Pro II ESC** - capable of handling aggressive throttle punches without desyncs.  
**iFlight XING 2207 Motors** - known for efficiency and smooth response.  
**DJI O4 Air Unit** - HD video transmission + onboard recording.  
**SupaFly 5” Carbon Fiber Frame** - light, rigid, and crash-resistant.  

Each choice was deliberate balancing weight, reliability, and ease of integration.

# Assembly Process
1. ### Frame Prep  
I started by dry fitting the carbon plates and standoffs, checking tolerances and clearance for the Air Unit and stack.

2. ### Motor & ESC Mounting  
The XING motors bolted neatly to the arms, and I routed the motor wires to the T-Motor 55A ESC mounted on vibration damping grommets.

3. ### Flight Controller Integration  
The F7 HD sat above the ESC in a standard 30x30 stack. This flight controller and ESC pair have a neat solderless connection for easier maintenance, nice!

4. ### Video & Receiver Wiring  
The DJI O4 Air Unit connected directly to the FC’s dedicated HD port, simplifying wiring and reducing potential video noise. The receiver was mounted away from high current lines to keep signal clean.

5. ### Final Assembly & Tidy-up  
Zip ties, custom 3D printed mounts, and heat shrink kept everything secure. A well built quad isn’t just about performance - clean wiring helps troubleshooting and maintenance later.
