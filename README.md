# Custom FPV Drone Build — From Parts to First Flight


For years, I’ve been fascinated by the drone scene. Watching drones capture cinematic shots or race through obstacles sparked my interest, and I wanted to give it a try. Having never built or even owned a drone before, I had a lot to learn. I began by brainstorming what I wanted from a drone since not all drones are built for the same purpose. I prioritized speed and maneuverability first, with range and flight time as secondary considerations. Once I had a clear vision, it was time to start purchasing parts and equipment.


# Parts & Components
Before touching a soldering iron, I gathered the core parts for the build.

Key Components:

**RadioMaster TX16S** - multi-protocol transmitter with hall-effect gimbals for precise stick feel.  
**DJI Goggles N3** - low-latency digital FPV system.  
**T-Motor F7 HD** - flight controller designed for clean integration with HD video systems.  
**T-Motor 55A Pro II ESC** - capable of handling aggressive throttle punches without desyncs.  
**iFlight XING 2207 Motors** - known for efficiency and smooth response.  
**DJI O4 Air Unit** - HD video transmission + onboard recording.  
**SupaFly 5” Carbon Fiber Frame** - light, rigid, and crash-resistant.  

Each choice was deliberate balancing weight, reliability, and ease of integration.
